## Ongoing Technical Assesment
### Evaluation challenge details:

If you are applying for a gameplay/UI role, please stay here and continue once you've completed the test below. If you are applying for another role, please continue until your corresponding section.

The goal is to create a Space Invaders type of game, using the base game design from space invaders. The spin we will add to this is that you must include a mechanic where the player can slow time down, stop time or reverse time after acquiring sufficient crystals (crystal details below).

The crystals you gather in this game are dropped at a 40% drop rate from the alien enemies, and at a 100% drop rate from elite enemies. We want 2 types of enemies and for the conduct to be a simple loop, similar to Space Invaders, where the players actions do not influence the enemy conduct in any dynamic way.

1 Crystal - Slow Time for 3 seconds<br>
2 Crystals - Stop Time for 3 seconds<br>
3 Crystals - Reverse Time 3 Seconds<br>

This should be done in Unreal Engine 5, and not 4.
Gameplay mechanics and core logic should be written in C++.
There should be three visually different enemy types, but all behave the same.
An enemy can shoot if no other enemy is in front of it.
Additionally a UFO will sometimes go across the top of the screen which the player can shoot for bonus points.
Enemies move left or right as a group and shift downward and change direction every time they reach the screen's edge.
Enemy group speed gradually increases as enemies are destroyed.
The player has three lives.
The game saves the highest score between sessions.
In each advancing level the enemies start one row lower, unless already at the lowest possible one.
Above the player are "bunkers" which get eroded when shot at by either the player or enemies, or if they get touched by enemies.
Cite your sources in your code comments if you use code/methods from elsewhere.
You're allowed to use Quixel Megascans or marketplace assets as long as they're assets only (no code or BP).
Feel free to change the visual theme of the game (it doesn't have to be in space).

You will be judged on:

How clean and organized your code is.<br>
How creatively you solve some of the presented problems.<br>
How decent your communication is.<br>

You will not be judged on:

How good it looks visually.<br>
How fast you deliver it.<br>
How much you resolve on your own.<br>

Good luck.
